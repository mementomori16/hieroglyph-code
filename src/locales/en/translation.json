His personality is exceptional, and this shines through in his work. He's not your typical programmer. I have a feeling he started that field of study simply to satisfy his brilliant mind. But Ilya's work is more than just coding. His range of experience seems endless, which makes his input incredibly valuable. He's knowledgeable in art as well as current technological developments. His creativity overflows. He genuinely invests himself in his work rather than just fulfilling a task. What's truly valuable is that he contributes for the benefit of the client. He's always thinking, \"What else could be helpful? What could make this new homepage even more up-to-date?\" Things I couldn't even imagine existed are commonplace for him, and he incorporates them. He also possesses a patience and kindness that made our collaboration incredibly pleasant. My objections, ideas, wishes... everything! He always took everything to heart and implemented it. Even when my work required something a bit old-fashioned, he made an absolute effort to find the best solution for me. It's a gift to have Ilya by my side, both for the design and the maintenance of my homepage.",
