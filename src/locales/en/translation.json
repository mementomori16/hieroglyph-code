His creativity overflows. He genuinely invests himself in his work rather than just fulfilling a task. What's truly valuable is that he contributes for the benefit of the client. He's always thinking, \"What else could be helpful? What could make this new homepage even more up-to-date?\" Things I couldn't even imagine existed are commonplace for him, and he incorporates them. He also possesses a patience and kindness that made our collaboration incredibly pleasant. My objections, ideas, wishes... everything! He always took everything to heart and implemented it.
